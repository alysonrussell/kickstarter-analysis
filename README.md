# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on KickStarter data to uncover trends
## Outcomes based on launch date
When we look at launch date as a variable in crowdfunding campaigns, we can make a few conclusions about trends.  Overall, the Theater category sees a high rate of successfully funded campaigns.  However, we can conclude that early summer seems to be the best time of year to launch a theater campaign, with a particularly high rate of success for campaigns launched in May.  Failed and cancelled campaigns do not seem to have any trends that coordinate with a certain month or season.
