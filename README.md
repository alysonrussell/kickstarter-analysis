# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on KickStarter data to uncover trends
## Parent Category Outcomes
First we will analyze categories of crowdfunding campaigns and the trends of their outcomes.  By looking at only the parent categories in our dataset, we can easily see that Theater campaigns are the most prevalent.  Within the theater category there are a large number of successful campaigns, but also quite a few that have failed.  We will want to look at other variables that may affect the outcome.

## Outcomes Based on Launch Date
When we look at launch date as a variable in crowdfunding campaigns, we can make a few conclusions about trends.  Overall, the Theater category sees a high rate of successfully funded campaigns.  However, we can conclude that early summer seems to be the best time of year to launch a theater campaign, with a particularly high rate of success for campaigns launched in May.  Failed and cancelled campaigns do not seem to have any trends that coordinate with a certain month or season.
